### Instructions

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a separate branch for your work. For example: `umer_branch`.

3. Do not push irrelevant files or directories (e.g., `searxng-docker`) to the repository. Add such files to the `.gitignore` to ensure they are ignored.

4. I have created a dummy filed named abc.txt inside the frontend folder. You can delete it and paste your frontend code in that folder.

5. To run the backend, follow the steps below:

   1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.

   2. Install Poetry by running `pip install poetry`.

   3. Inside the `backend` folder, run `poetry install` to install all the required packages for the backend.

   4. Once the packages are installed, run `poetry run python manage.py runserver` to start the backend server.
